This chess game is my first personal push on github and my first project on ReactJs. The goal of this project is to learn more about Javascript ES6 and basic features on ReactJs as Compenents , props and lifecycle and Components.

The project is not over yet, I have to work on some features and bugs listed below :

- Warning messages about the check and checkmate and other some stuff.
- Rework the css of the board.
- Rework the code to make it easier to read and update.
- Fix the restart game option.
- Add a visual on pieces lost during the game.

Later I will try to add a websocket feature with nodeJs. The goal of that feature is to learn to use Javascript ES6 deeper, learn the basics of nodeJs and websocket.
